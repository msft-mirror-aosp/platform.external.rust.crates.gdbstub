//! Traits to encode architecture-specific target information.
//!
//! # Community created `Arch` Implementations
//!
//! Before getting your hands dirty and implementing a new `Arch` from scratch,
//! make sure to check out [`gdbstub_arch`](https://docs.rs/gdbstub_arch), a
//! companion crate to `gdbstub` which aggregates community-created `Arch`
//! implementations for most common architectures!
//!
//! > _Note:_ Prior to `gdbstub 0.5`, `Arch` implementations were distributed as
//! a part of the main `gdbstub` crate (under the `gdbstub::arch` module). This
//! wasn't ideal, any `gdbstub::arch`-level breaking-changes forced the _entire_
//! `gdbstub` crate to release a new (potentially breaking!) version.
//!
//! > Having community-created `Arch` implementations distributed in a separate
//! crate helps minimize any unnecessary "version churn" in `gdbstub` core.
